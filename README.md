# Vivek — Personal Website

A minimalist personal website (GitHub Pages ready), inspired by academic templates like https://anilgogebakan.github.io/ but with original code and styling.

## 🚀 Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. **Create a new repo** named `vivek` (or `vivek.github.io` if your GitHub username is `vivek`).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo root (keep the same structure).
3. In your repository, go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master`) → `/ (root)` → **Save**
4. Your site will be available at:
   - Project site: `https://<your-username>.github.io/vivek`
   - Or user site (if repo is `vivek.github.io`): `https://vivek.github.io`

## 🧩 Customize

- Replace `assets/avatar.png` with your photo (keep the same filename).
- Replace `assets/Vivek_CV.pdf` with your CV.
- Edit links (email, GitHub, LinkedIn) in `index.html` sidebar and Contact section.
- Update About/Research/Projects/Teaching sections as needed.
- Colors and spacing are in `styles.css`.

## 📁 Structure

```
/
├─ index.html
├─ styles.css
├─ script.js
├─ assets/
│  ├─ avatar.png        # placeholder image
│  └─ Vivek_CV.pdf      # placeholder CV
└─ README.md
```

## 📝 Notes

- This is a fresh implementation; no third‑party CSS frameworks required.
- The layout mirrors the *structure* (sidebar + main content) typical of academic pages but uses original HTML/CSS.
